GitHub Repo Search
A GitHub Repository Search web application built using React.js, allowing users to search for repositories on GitHub by entering a keyword. The app fetches data from the GitHub API and displays repository name, description, star count, and a link to the repository. It has a modern, visually appealing design with animations and fancy fonts.
